This website was made for an MSc. TP4b project in physics conducted within the Particle Physics Department at EPFL, under the supervision of Dr. Alison Tully.

The main purpose of this website is to support the [TP4b report](/assets/materials/TP4b_rep.pdf).

You can see my other projects by clicking the github link in the footer. Please send me your feedback at patrickodagiu@gmail.com or at the EPFL email found in the EPFL footer link.
